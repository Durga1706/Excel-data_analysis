# Charts: When and When not
## Bar chart:
   * When: To compare data across categories
   * When not: If there are too many categories or if the data is continuous
   * Type: Categorical, quantitative

## Line chart:
   * When: To show trend over time 
   * When not: When there is no relationship between data points
   * Type: Continuous, time series

## Donut chart:
   * When: To show the proportion of each category
   * When not: If there are too many categories or comparing data across groups
   * Type: Categorical, proportional

## Scatter plot:
   * When: To display the relationship between two variables
   * When not: If there is irrelavant relation or comparing multiple categories

##  Calculated Column
### Combine two columns
[col 1] & "-" & [col 2]   -> Hello-World
[col1 ] - [col 2]   -> subtract columns

### Measure 
When we have measure it can be used everywhere, if in future column name changes we can edit that in measure it will be updated everywhere
we have a column called Sales, in 10 charts if we used sum of sales it has to be updated 10 times if Sales name changes in future

Sum([col])
Sum([col 1]) - Sum([col 2])

### Previous year sales
calculate( Sum([Sales Amount]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR([Date]) )


## Most used DAX functions
### Aggregated Function
sum/ sumx
average/ averagex
min/ minx
max/ maxx
count/ distinctcount

## Calender
### calendarauto(): returns a single column named 'Date' that contains a contiguous set of dates. The range of dates is calculated automatically based on data in the model.
syntax: calendarauto() : generates date based on our model
        calendarauto([fiscal_year_end_month]): dax expression that returns an integer from 1 to 12

If our date column has min date: 1-3-2023, max date: 1-3-2024
Start date: 1st month and day of min data year(1-1-2023)
End date: last month and day of max data year(31-12-2024)

fiscal_year_end_month can't be end before max date in data model
If our date is 31/12/2022, calendarauto(3)  then 31/3/2023 since our fiscal_year_end_month< max_date 
                           calendarauto(1)  then 31/1/2023 since our fiscal_year_end_month< max_date 
               1/3/2022,   calendarauto(3)  then 31/3/2022 since our fiscal_year_end_month= max_date 

Note: Date column should exist in our data model, otherwise it will give error

### calendar(): returns a single column named 'Date' that contains a contiguous set of dates.
syntax: calendar(<start_date>, <end_date>)
Eg: calendar(date(2022,01,01), date(2022,12,31))  :- date(yy,mm,dd)
    calendar(date(2022,01,01), date(2022,12,40)) : generates dates from 2022 jan 1 to 2023 jan 9; 40-31=9 adds 9 days next month
